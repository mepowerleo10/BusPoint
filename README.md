# BusPoint
An Android app to find the nearest bus stops for public transportation services in Tanzania (Daladala)

## Architecture
The application has several components interacting to provide reliable services:
- MapBox API provides Tiling, Rendering and Navigation Services
- Google Places API provides location search services (I hope to build a custom search service in the future)

## Development Environment
- Run and Tested on Android 8
- Android Studio on Linux
